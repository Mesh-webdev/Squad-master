# Short description
Squad master is aimed to help and improve the amateur
football player condition in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Amateur football players are
usually constrained by the limited ways of communications, gathering of player and
players no-shows. The system we proposed specifically aims to solve these issues by
providing a platform for easier communication between players and other organizations.
We believe that the system has a very good protentional and is unique to the local market.
Squad master is developed software platform to enable players to
communicate with each other, and associate and link all the parties involved. The software
would be able to maintain potential playersâ€™ name, positions, match time, and location, all
of which will help enhance the experience of an amateur player.
